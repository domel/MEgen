Convenient online form to generate structured data about molecules. MEgen supports all common structured data formats - [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), [RDFa](http://rdfa.info/) and [Microdata](https://schema.org/docs/gs.html). Written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/). It needs a HTTP server to work (e.g. [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)). You can also use [Docker image](https://github.com/lszeremeta/megen-docker) to run app fast and easy.

## What are structured data

Structured data are additional data placed on websites. They are not visible to ordinary internet users, but can be easily processed by machines. There are 3 formats that we can use to save structured data - [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), [RDFa](http://rdfa.info/) and [Microdata](https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/). MEgen supports them all and use [MolecularEntitly](https://bioschemas.org/types/MolecularEntity/) type.
